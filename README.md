# Using Data Mining to Predict the Outcome of a League of Legends Professional Match
Research paper project done for my CUS610 Data Mining class during my masters where I utilized a free dataset from Kaggle, Python and different data mining and analysis techniques to gather information about the most played and most effective characters to play. An attempt was also done to target a specific team in this case the world champions to find patterns and trends that would allow to give an advantage against them, but the low amount of matches played in a year made it difficult.
